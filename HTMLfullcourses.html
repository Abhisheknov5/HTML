        <abbr title="World health organization">WHO</abbr> The World Health Organization is the international body responsible for public health. Known as the WHO, it is part of the United Nations and was established in 1948. It is involved in many aspects of health policy and planning.

        The WHO has played a major role in many of the public health successes of the last few decades. It was instrumental in the global eradication of smallpox, which used to be one of the world’s biggest killers. It has also run a campaign that has achieved the near-eradication of polio, and has worked for decades to reduce the threat from malaria.

        The seven islands that came to constitute Mumbai were home to communities of fishing colonies of the Koli people.
        For centuries, the islands were under the control of successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the
         Portuguese Empire and subsequently to the East India Company when in 1661 Charles II of England married Catherine
         of Braganza and as part of her dowry Charles received the ports of Tangier and Seven Islands of Bombay.
         During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project, which undertook reclamation of the 
         area between the seven islands from the sea.Along with construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project,
         completed in 1845, transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Bombay in the 19th century was characterised
         by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence
         movement.</p>>
         <p id="local"> Upon India’s independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta 
         Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital.As the city that never sleeps and 
         famous for its high-end malls and lucrative streets. Mumbai City also known as Bombay, offers unique experiences, from the 
         beautiful promenades to the cosmopolitan culture Known as the city of dreams (Mayanagri), it is the capital city of the Indian 
         state of Maharashtra. Mumbai is also the second most populous city in India with a population of 19.98million. Moreover, 
         it lies on the Konkan coast, which is on the west coast of India, with its very own natural harbour.
         Back in 2008 Mumbai was named an alpha world's city and it's the wealthiest city with the largest number of millionaires
         and billionaires in all of the cities in India. Generally, the city serves as headquarters to some of the financial institutions 
         like the National Stock Exchange, Reserve Bank of India and the Mint among many others.
